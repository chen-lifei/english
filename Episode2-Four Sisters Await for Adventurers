Mount Siguniang or Mount Four Sisters is located in southwestern China's Sichuan province. The mountain gets its name from its four peaks adjacent to each other.



Local legend says that the mountain god's four beautiful daughters defeated the devil and turned into four snow mountains to guard the local people. The snowy mountains offer one of the toughest challenges for those who would like to conquer them.



Out of the four sisters, the youngest one -- the Yaomei Peak is the highest and the steepest of them all, with the altitude of 6250 meters. 



Only the bravest climbers around the world dare to take the challenge. There are glaciers hanging on the southern slope and extending to the foot of the mountain. The western and the northern slope are formed by the daunting steep rocks. 



So far, the summit record for the Yaomei Peak is only 11 times. The Japanese and the American made it twice each. the British, the French and the Russian teams made it once each, and the Chinese team reached the top for 4 times.



Besides the four remarkable peaks, Mount Siguniang also has lots of other mountains and valleys that are ready for exploration. The 5484-meters high Camel Peak is formed by two connected peaks. Between them there is a glacial plain. But right behind these glaciers, is a vertical cliff. 



And we have the Pomiu Peak that looks like a pyramid. Five Colours Mountain with an altitude of 5500 meters, and the Hunter Mountain with an altitude of 5182 meters.



Thanks for its breath-taking and wide landscape, Mount Siguniang is also known as “The Oriental Alps”. 



For the bravest adventurers worldwide, the Four Sisters will continue to lure them and wait for the next one to stand on top of them. 作者：酷陪Coupe https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv8040570/?from=readlist 出处：bilibili
