Hidden deep in the mountains of western China's Sichuan province, there is a primitive and dreamy valley called Jiuzhaigou.



It has preserved one of the most stunning view of nature that it could be called China's Garden of Eden. Its signature landscape is the crystal lakes with turquoise and many other colors of white, blue, green, or emerald. 



The secrets of coloring the lake is the spirogyra, charophyte, and other kinds of ferns that grow in the water. They contain chlorophyll, which helps create various colors. These colors vary according to the season, light and the viewing angle. 



There are 108 Lakes like this dotted around the three major valleys in Jiuzhaigou. Each of these valleys has an altitude higher than 2000 meters and altogether the valleys are 49 kilometers long. 



Besides these magical lakes, Jiuzhaigou also has China's widest waterfall, Nuorilang Waterfall, with a width of 270 meters. If you visit Jiuzhaigou during the right time, you may even experience the rotation of four seasons in one day. From the colorful scene to the white appearance, Jiuzhaigou could do it in very short time. 



It is perhaps the ultimate fairy land in China.
