Located in the northeast of China, the Changbai Mountains is named after its iconic scenery of being perpetually white almost all year long.



These mountains were formed around 2.77 million years ago, after volcano eruptions due to the movement of the earth crust.



At the top of the main mountain there is a crater lake with an altitude of 2,100 meters. It is called “Tian-Chi” in Chinese, literally meaning heaven lake. Its latest eruption happened around 300 years ago.



Tianchi is the largest crater lake in China, and it is the deepest mountain lake around the world as well. The average depth of water is 204 meters. It has stored over 2 billion tons of fresh water, which is able to supply the population in Beijing downtown for 22 months.



The winter lasts for 9 months in the Changbai Mountains. Thus, the crest of the mountain is covered by snow most of the time. The depth of the snow is 50 centimeters on average.



It is extremely difficult to visit the mountain during the winter. Lake Tianchi only melts in Mid-July due to the cold weather and the water in the lake is flowing for only 30 days every year. 



It is always misty and cloudy. According to the locals, people could only see the most imposing scenery here if they have a special mysterious connection with this magical mountain.
